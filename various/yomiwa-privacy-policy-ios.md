The team working on the Yomiwa app is committed to privacy. Currently, the the Yomiwa app does not gather any user information.

# 1 ‐ App permissions

1.1 ‐ Access to Camera

Access to your Camera will be asked whenever you want to use the real-time Japanese recognizer.

1.2 ‐ Access to pictures

When you load a picture from your camera roll, no permission is needed since the Yomiwa app will only have access to the single photo that the user decides to pick. However, access to writing to your photo library may be asked in you want to save a picture of the Yomiwa Wall to your own photo library.
