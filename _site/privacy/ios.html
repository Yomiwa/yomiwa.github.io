<h1 id="1--app-permissions">1 ‐ App permissions</h1>

<p>1.1 ‐ Access to Camera</p>

<p>Access to your Camera will be asked whenever you want to use the optical character recognition algorithms through your camera.</p>

<p>1.2 ‐ Access to pictures</p>

<p>When you load a picture from your camera roll, no permission is needed since the Yomiwa/HanYou apps will only have access to the single photo that the you chose. Writing access to your photo library may be asked in you want to save a picture from the Yomiwa/HanYou Wall to your own photo library. For the latter, permission will be asked at your first try.</p>
