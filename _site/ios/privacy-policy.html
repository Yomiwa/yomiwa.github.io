        <p>The team working on the Chord AI app is committed to privacy. Currently, the Chord AI app does not gather any user information.</p>

<h1 id="1--app-permissions">1 ‐ App permissions</h1>

<p>1.1 ‐ Access to microphone</p>

<p>Access to your device microphone will be asked in order to perform Chord AI’s main functionality: analyzing sound to perform real-time chord recognition.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to grant access to the microphone, Chord AI can only be used on your on-device audio files that are not DRM-protected. In that case the recognition algorithm has directly access to the file audio data.</p>

<p>1.2 ‐ Media library usage</p>

<p>Access to your device music library will be necessary if you want to select and play a song from your music library without leaving the app, and also be able to control the playback from within the app.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to grant access to your music library, you can still use the Chord AI app to perform real-time chord recognition by first selecting the song from another app (such as the Apple Music app or the Spotify app), then switching to the Chord AI app.</p>

<h1 id="2--payment-transactions">2 ‐ Payment transactions</h1>

<p>All payments are handled by the Apple Store. We do not get any identification information about you (name, age, e-mail address…). The app knows whether or not you own a feature by asking the Apple Store.</p>
